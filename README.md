# Calculator

This is the simple calculator implementation on Vue 3.

![Preview](docs/img/preview.png)

**Note**: don't use this project for accurate calculations. I implemented this project to train my skills in UI programming on Vue 3. I didn't pay enough attention to the calculation function. So, this calculator implementation can make seriously  mistakes in calculations.
